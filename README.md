# Unofficial ROLLER Implementation Using ​TVM 0.21+

This repository contains an unofficial modern implementation of the paper named *ROLLER: Fast and Efficient Tensor Compilation for Deep Learning*, rebuilt using the latest version of TVM (Apache TVM 0.21+).

## A. About ROLLER

ROLLER is a fast and efficient tensor compilation system for deep learning workloads. Unlike search-based approaches that can take hours to find optimal kernels, ROLLER uses a construction-based approach that generates highly efficient kernels in seconds.

#### ​​1. Original Paper:​

- [ROLLER: Fast and Efficient Tensor Compilation for Deep Learning](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/zhu) (OSDI'22)

#### 2. Key Features:​​

- Novel rTile abstraction that encapsulates tensor shapes aligned with accelerator characteristics.
- Recursive construction algorithm for generating efficient rTile-based programs.
- Micro-performance model for rapid evaluation without device execution.
- Support for various accelerators including GPUs and emerging AI chips.

## B. Installation

- ~~This implementation requires TVM 0.21 or newer. Please install the latest version of TVM following the official [installation guide](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/index.html).~~
- This implementation requires TVM 0.21+. The specific commit hash used in my build is `d4e7bd3e19a4c786a7b737abea8cad7c3a5a95df`.

  > **<ins>Important Note</ins>**: The latest TVM version has undergone significant changes and may no longer be compatible. To avoid potential errors, please use the exact commit below to install TVM from source:
  > ```bash
  > git checkout d4e7bd3e19a4c786a7b737abea8cad7c3a5a95df
  > ```
  > Then, you can follow the official [installation guide](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/d4e7bd3e19a4c786a7b737abea8cad7c3a5a95df/docs/install/from_source.rst) corresponding to **this commit** to continue the installation.

## C. Usage

```python3
python test_op.py
```

## E. Roadmap & Contributing

1. The codebase has not been fully organized and refactored.
2. Scripts in the original Roller repository are not included and have not been thoroughly tested in this new environment.

This repo is currently in its early stages. We are actively working towards a stable and feature-complete release. We welcome and appreciate any contributions!

## F. Acknowledgments

This implementation is based on the original ROLLER research from Microsoft Research and collaborating institutions. The original implementation can be found at: [microsoft/nnfusion](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/tree/osdi22_artifact/artifacts).
